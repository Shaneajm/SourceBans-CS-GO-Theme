# Sourcebans CS:GO Theme

## Why this version?
The original theme uses insecure image URLs to pull images for the header and navbar. This can pose an issue when trying to use SSL certificates as the page gets mixed content warnings. This fork fixes that problem as images are loaded via Imgur (which uses HTTPS) rather than the Steam image service.

## How to install
1. Download the master branch zip file.
2. Copy the contents inside over to your sourcebans directory.
3. Clear the cache for Sourcebans via the admin panel.
4. Activate the theme.
